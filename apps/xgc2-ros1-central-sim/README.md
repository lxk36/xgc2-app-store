# XGC2 ROS1 Central Simulation

This app is the immutable ROS Noetic and Gazebo Classic runtime for the first
XGC2 centralized simulation mode. It runs the shared ROS master, Gazebo server,
VRPN bridge and all configured FS150 and Scout Mini robots in one disposable
container.

The image derives from `xgc-ros1-runtime:1.2.3`. XGC2 products are installed
from `https://xgc2.apt.xiaokang.ink` only while the image is built. Container
startup never runs `apt update` or installs products.

Exact direct product versions live in `packages.lock`. Change the lock and bump
the app version whenever the simulation release set changes.

QGroundControl 4.4.4 is downloaded with a pinned SHA-256 and extracted while the
image is built. Runtime execution uses the extracted `AppRun` tree and never
requires FUSE inside the container. QGC configuration and cache data use a
dedicated persistent volume, while the simulation container remains disposable.

Run QGroundControl after the container starts with:

```bash
qgroundcontrol
```

Set `HOST_XAUTHORITY` to the current desktop session's Xauthority file and set
`USER_UID`/`USER_GID` to the desktop user's IDs. The compose file mounts that
file read-only and QGC runs as the matching non-root user.

Set `QGC_FORCE_SOFTWARE_OPENGL=1` only when the host GPU/driver combination
cannot render QGC correctly through the container.

PX4 1.14, product source trees and build toolchains are intentionally excluded.

## Local build

```bash
docker build -t xgc2-ros1-central-sim:local .
docker run --rm xgc2-ros1-central-sim:local \
  /usr/local/bin/xgc2-central-sim-healthcheck
docker run --rm xgc2-ros1-central-sim:local \
  /usr/local/bin/xgc2-central-sim-smoke
```

The repository build workflow pushes versioned and `latest` tags to GHCR. When
all domestic-registry secrets are configured, the same workflow also pushes
the same tags to the configured domestic registry.
