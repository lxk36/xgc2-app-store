# XGC2 App Store

Open app definitions and container images for XGC2.

This repository is intentionally small at the first stage. GitHub is used as the
app catalog server, and GitHub Container Registry is used for image hosting. No
public deployment server is required until XGC needs remote, unattended CD.

## Apps

App categories are intentionally limited to three operator-facing types:

- `simulation`: SITL, Gazebo, QGroundControl and simulator support images.
- `deployment`: multi-architecture images intended for robot or field hosts.
- `development`: source development and debugging workstations.

## Catalog

XGC can sync the static catalog from:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxk36/xgc2-app-store/master/catalog/index.yml
```

The catalog points to app files in this repository and GHCR images built by CI.

## Image Build

Only app definitions changed by a commit are built or mirrored. The detector
looks for changes under:

```text
apps/<app-key>/
```

An app without `apps/<app-key>/Dockerfile` is treated as an external-image app.
CI reads `upstreamImage` from `app.yml` and mirrors that image into the XGC app
registry tags. If the app declares multiple architectures, CI copies the full
manifest list so deployment hosts can pull the matching architecture.

Deleting an `apps/<app-key>/` directory is detected and reported by CI, but
registry tag deletion is intentionally not automated. Remove old image tags
manually after confirming no deployment still references them.

For buildable apps, CI uses native GitHub-hosted runners for each architecture:
`ubuntu-latest` for amd64 and `ubuntu-24.04-arm` for arm64. QEMU is not used for
the production image build path. For pull requests, CI builds changed images
without pushing. For `master`, CI always pushes:

```text
ghcr.io/lxk36/xgc2-app-store/<app-key>:latest
ghcr.io/lxk36/xgc2-app-store/<app-key>:<version>
```

Multi-architecture buildable apps also push architecture tags before manifest
assembly:

```text
ghcr.io/lxk36/xgc2-app-store/<app-key>:latest-amd64
ghcr.io/lxk36/xgc2-app-store/<app-key>:latest-arm64
ghcr.io/lxk36/xgc2-app-store/<app-key>:<version>-amd64
ghcr.io/lxk36/xgc2-app-store/<app-key>:<version>-arm64
```

If domestic registry secrets are configured, CI also pushes the same image tags
to that registry:

```text
<XGC_CN_REGISTRY>/<XGC_CN_NAMESPACE>/<app-key>:latest
<XGC_CN_REGISTRY>/<XGC_CN_NAMESPACE>/<app-key>:<version>
```

The recommended first domestic target is an Aliyun ACR namespace dedicated to
XGC app images, for example:

```text
registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/xgc2-app-store
```

Keep this namespace public if deployment hosts should pull without `docker
login`. Keep it private only when every deployment host can be preconfigured
with registry credentials.

### Domestic Registry Secrets

Add these repository secrets under GitHub repository Settings -> Secrets and
variables -> Actions -> Repository secrets:

| Secret | Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `XGC_CN_REGISTRY` | `registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com` | Registry host. Do not include a namespace. |
| `XGC_CN_NAMESPACE` | `xgc2-app-store` | Registry namespace/project for XGC app images. |
| `XGC_CN_USERNAME` | `xgc2-ci` | Registry username or service account. |
| `XGC_CN_PASSWORD` | `***` | Registry password or access token. |

The workflow does not print these values. If any domestic registry setting is
missing, the GHCR push still works and the domestic push is skipped.

## Image Garbage Collection

Stale image deletion is separated from the normal build workflow. Pushes and
pull requests never delete registry content.

Use the manual workflow `GC stale app images` to list or delete GHCR packages
whose app key is no longer present in `catalog/index.yml`.

For user-owned packages, add repository secret `GHCR_GC_TOKEN` with
`read:packages` for dry-runs and both `read:packages` and `delete:packages` for
deletion. If the secret is absent, the workflow falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
which may not be allowed to list user-level packages.

Default mode is dry-run:

```text
delete=false
app=all
keep_last=0
```

Set `delete=true` only after confirming deployments no longer reference the old
app key. `keep_last` can retain the newest package versions for rollback during
a transition.

The workflow only deletes GHCR package versions. Aliyun ACR cleanup is reported
as an operator follow-up because it requires separate registry permissions and
should be confirmed against active deployments.

The same dry-run can be started locally when the `gh` token has `read:packages`:

```bash
scripts/gc-ghcr-images.sh --owner lxk36 --repo xgc2-app-store
```

## Local Smoke

```bash
docker build -t xgc-ros1-runtime:local apps/xgc-ros1-runtime
docker run --rm xgc-ros1-runtime:local bash -lc \
  'source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash && rosversion -d && roscore --help >/dev/null'
```

For GUI/Gazebo usage, run through the app compose file or mount X11 manually.
